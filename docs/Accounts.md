# Accounts

This is where we record core accounts and who owns access.

- GitHub org: hireahuman
- Email identity: dev@hireahuman.com
- DB: Neon (Postgres)
- Issue tracking: Linear
- Error tracking: Sentry (planned)
- Analytics: PostHog (planned)

All passwords / API keys must live in the shared vault (1Password/Bitwarden), never in docs.
